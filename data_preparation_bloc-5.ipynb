         "Purchased this to replace an 8 yr old Samsung 2.1 sound bar which also had a wireless bass but it started switching inputs randomly.<br /><br />We installed this under our 75” LG and connected it via optical. We only used the mounting button screws from the mounting kit. Luckily it fit our sound bar mounting bars, though they do stick down a bit further than when the Samsung was installed. See mounted photo.<br /><br />The control buttons are located on the top of the unit and are easily accessible even when mounted to under a television. See photo.<br /><br />The unit is a dark grey. For some reason I just assumed it was black, but next to our television, it’s noticeably different.<br /><br />We control our setup with a Logitech touchscreen remote which powers on the sound bar first, then the television, then the broadcasting source. The universal remote connects easily and has no difficulties in controlling the bar. We do experience the occasional misfire where the bar does not turn on with the other devices. Possibly 5% of the time. Luckily like I said the buttons are easily accessible.<br /><br />The LCD display is nice and large. The only gripe I have is that it does not stay on. After displaying, it just goes blank.<br /><br />The sound itself is better than what comes out of the television. Is it as good or deep as our old Samsung, not even close. The sound doesn’t fill the room, nor is it as rich. The bass is ok, but I can’t  feel it in the hardwood floors like our old Samsung. The volume has a large range but it really doesn’t improve the quality.<br /><br />For a budget sound bar it’s just ok. It doesn’t knock my socks off but it is better than not having a sound bar. Could it’s sound be better and the bass even more deep? Yes..do I miss the old sound bar, also Yes.. should I return this one and keep looking, I probably won’t. Too much of a hassle, but if I knew it wasn’t going to stack up I would have passed.",

         "All I was looking for is a simple NAS.  Network Attached Storage.  Storage; that all I wanted.  But I can’t figure out how get more than one file to it at a time.  Windows has been doing drag and drop for over twenty years, but nope, not with this thing.  You can see it in Windows Explorer, but can’t drag and drop to it.<br /><br />So, since it is a NAS, maybe there has to be some sort of interface as it is attached to a network.  Understandable.  So, in its kind of explorer program, you can see some pre-established folders.  But any folder you create has to be in one of these folders.  So, it looks like you have to organize your data the way they want and not the way you want.<br /><br />I have spent a couple of hours with this thing and this looks like the way it has to be.  Maybe there is a better way, but I don’t have the time to figure it out. This thing barely comes with any instructions. All you get is picture menu instructions on how to install a drive.  I have other things that need to get done  All I wanted was a NAS to drag and drop my RAID data to once a month.<br /><br />The reason I gave it two stars is it probably functioning as designed and others seem to like it.  For me, it is going back and I will just get a USB 3.0 enclosure for the drive I was going to put in this thing.<br /><br />What I did like:<br />The initial setup is fairly simple.  Once you get the drive installed, and on the network, it takes about 10 minutes to install its “OS” and give it a network name.  After that, good luck.<br /><br />While poking around, I did see where you could assign a static address.<br /><br />I did find settings where you can control the brightness of the LEDs; including turning them off.<br /><br />Can’t think of anything else<br /><br />What I didn’t like:<br />Minimal instructions.  It took a while to figure out how to get into it to install the drive even though the case screws come uninstalled.  It is unclear which screws go where.  They could have put it in the picture menu instructions or printed it on the screw packages,<br /><br />It feels super cheap.  It is 90% plastic.<br /><br />No drag and drop file movement or at least a way to move a bulk number of files.  I couldn’t figure it out.<br />Overly complicated and full stuff I wont use.  Maybe in the setup process they should ask you how you intend to use it and turn on only those features.  Later you can turn on features if you want them.",

         "First, let me address some of the issues or non-issues that I have seen on other reviews:<br />1.  Banner issue-  I have yet to see the banner, I didn't see it upon start up and turned it off in the setting and that is it.<br />2. Poor sound-  Although granted, out of the box the sound is poor, but with a little tweeking of the sound adjustments, including turning on the surrond sound,  it is not bad at all.  Consider though, my set is sitting on a stand rather than on the wall, that could make a difference.<br />3.  I have seen some comments about a dead hdmi connector-  I think this is just mistaken.  The tv senses when a device is connected to it , and thus may seem dead when really it is only not getting some signal from the device.<br />4.  I see some complaints about not being able to turn off the internal speakers or the fact that the internal speakers aren't cut off immediately by plugging in the optical connection.  This is completely bogus, in fact Panasonic was smart about this.  For some of us who connect to an analog amplifier through a converter, we appreciate the fact that the speakers remain on and we use the amplifier only when playing some music and movies.  By the way the complaint about the mute button staying on has apparently been rectified because it now goes off within a short time.<br />5. wi-fi dropping off issues.  I have hi speed and my router is approximately 25 ft. from my set.  I have had no drop off issues at all and am absolutely loving the Pandora app with or with the internal speakers.  Love the fact that you can turn off the screen and enjoy hours of music without it on using minimal energy. Cudos to Panasonic<br />6.If I were to complain about anything, it would be the short power cord to this unit.  Really, give it another 3 or 4 feet.<br />7. Some people complain about the &#34;on light&#34; being on rather than off while the unit is operating.  Panasonic rightly designed it that way because of the ability to turn off the screen and still have it function while using the apps.<br /><br />I calibrated the tv using Mr. Wiley's settings and CNets guidance.  I personally found Mr. Wileys a slightly better picture except for keeping the Al  setting on instead of off.  These setting can be found by searching online.<br /><br />In conclusion, although the picture quality of this tv may not be quite up to the DLP and Plasma quality it is still a quality tv with an enjoyable smart tv experience.",

         "I got one of these to stream a webcam from a remote location, and it's quite well suited to the task. It sits out of the way, makes no sound whatsoever, uses almost no electricity, and rarely needs any attention.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The first thing that struck me after opening the box was how well-designed the case is. The power section has interchangeable connectors to either plug directly into the wall or to run a power cord (included) if you need to set the box some distance from an outlet. It can also slide entirely off from the rest of the computer, revealing coaxial power connectors on both sections that can be connected with another (included) cable; in this configuration, the power section can again plug directly into the wall (making it a wall wart separate from the computer) or use the power cord (making it an in-line power brick, like you'd see with a laptop).<br /><br />The next thing I really liked was that it came pre-installed with Debian, including all the packages needed to take full advantage of the hardware, and nothing extra. I've been using Debian for some time, so working with the DreamPlug felt familiar. The installed version of Debian was one release old when I received it, but that's not surprising, considering I got the DreamPlug just two weeks after the Wheezy release.<br /><br />Lastly, it's impressive just how many different things you're able to do with the included hardware. My webcam scenario is a very modest use of the device's capabilities. The default install includes a web server whose landing page describes a bunch of interesting uses for the DreamPlug.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Updating to the latest Debian release proved to be over my head. Simply changing the apt sources to pull Wheezy and doing a dist-upgrade resulted first in the apt cache overrunning the memory, and then the computer not be accessible after a reboot. The first time this happened, I was thankful for a reset button that allows you to restore the factory image when you hold it in for six seconds. That worked perfectly the first time I crashed it. Unfortunately, the second time I crashed it (again attempting to do an in-place dist-upgrade), the machine got stuck in a reboot loop.<br />On the upside, the reset button is a nice touch and works as advertised.<br /><br />There's a JTAG unit you can buy from GlobalScale, and you really should get it. It's hard to find on their web site because it's not listed on the DreamPlug page (or the SheevaPlug page or the SmilePlug page or the MiraBox page or the D3 page or the GTCam page); it's only shown on the GuruPlug page, and there's nothing to suggest it works with the DreamPlug. But it does. And you should get it. Because at some point you'll need it, and when you do, you _really_ need it.<br />On the upside, between the JTAG unit and excellent web help (like [...] there's no such thing as an insurmountable software problem. And the aforementioned newit site has plenty of up-to-date system images to flash to your DreamPlug, including some non-Debian options.<br /><br />The RAM is only 512MB, and the CPU is painfully slow for interactive tasks (like the aptitude package manager). Granted, with no video capabilities, this isn't meant to be an interactive computer. But when you have to shell in and make configuration changes or apply security patches, you'd better have a bit of time on your hands.<br /><br />I should mention that although I absolutely love the case, I did manage to strip a screw one of the times that I was opening it to replace the internal microSD card.<br />On the upside, it's not hard to open the case. Just remove the four feet (they pull straight out) and there are the screws.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I really like this little box. It's kind of like a Raspberry Pi in a very nice package, with some extra goodies.",

         "Purchased this to replace an 8 yr old Samsung 2.1 sound bar which also had a wireless bass but it started switching inputs randomly.<br /><br />We installed this under our 75” LG and connected it via optical. We only used the mounting button screws from the mounting kit. Luckily it fit our sound bar mounting bars, though they do stick down a bit further than when the Samsung was installed. See mounted photo.<br /><br />The control buttons are located on the top of the unit and are easily accessible even when mounted to under a television. See photo.<br /><br />The unit is a dark grey. For some reason I just assumed it was black, but next to our television, it’s noticeably different.<br /><br />We control our setup with a Logitech touchscreen remote which powers on the sound bar first, then the television, then the broadcasting source. The universal remote connects easily and has no difficulties in controlling the bar. We do experience the occasional misfire where the bar does not turn on with the other devices. Possibly 5% of the time. Luckily like I said the buttons are easily accessible.<br /><br />The LCD display is nice and large. The only gripe I have is that it does not stay on. After displaying, it just goes blank.<br /><br />The sound itself is better than what comes out of the television. Is it as good or deep as our old Samsung, not even close. The sound doesn’t fill the room, nor is it as rich. The bass is ok, but I can’t  feel it in the hardwood floors like our old Samsung. The volume has a large range but it really doesn’t improve the quality.<br /><br />For a budget sound bar it’s just ok. It doesn’t knock my socks off but it is better than not having a sound bar. Could it’s sound be better and the bass even more deep? Yes..do I miss the old sound bar, also Yes.. should I return this one and keep looking, I probably won’t. Too much of a hassle, but if I knew it wasn’t going to stack up I would have passed.",

         "All I was looking for is a simple NAS.  Network Attached Storage.  Storage; that all I wanted.  But I can’t figure out how get more than one file to it at a time.  Windows has been doing drag and drop for over twenty years, but nope, not with this thing.  You can see it in Windows Explorer, but can’t drag and drop to it.<br /><br />So, since it is a NAS, maybe there has to be some sort of interface as it is attached to a network.  Understandable.  So, in its kind of explorer program, you can see some pre-established folders.  But any folder you create has to be in one of these folders.  So, it looks like you have to organize your data the way they want and not the way you want.<br /><br />I have spent a couple of hours with this thing and this looks like the way it has to be.  Maybe there is a better way, but I don’t have the time to figure it out. This thing barely comes with any instructions. All you get is picture menu instructions on how to install a drive.  I have other things that need to get done  All I wanted was a NAS to drag and drop my RAID data to once a month.<br /><br />The reason I gave it two stars is it probably functioning as designed and others seem to like it.  For me, it is going back and I will just get a USB 3.0 enclosure for the drive I was going to put in this thing.<br /><br />What I did like:<br />The initial setup is fairly simple.  Once you get the drive installed, and on the network, it takes about 10 minutes to install its “OS” and give it a network name.  After that, good luck.<br /><br />While poking around, I did see where you could assign a static address.<br /><br />I did find settings where you can control the brightness of the LEDs; including turning them off.<br /><br />Can’t think of anything else<br /><br />What I didn’t like:<br />Minimal instructions.  It took a while to figure out how to get into it to install the drive even though the case screws come uninstalled.  It is unclear which screws go where.  They could have put it in the picture menu instructions or printed it on the screw packages,<br /><br />It feels super cheap.  It is 90% plastic.<br /><br />No drag and drop file movement or at least a way to move a bulk number of files.  I couldn’t figure it out.<br />Overly complicated and full stuff I wont use.  Maybe in the setup process they should ask you how you intend to use it and turn on only those features.  Later you can turn on features if you want them.",

         "First, let me address some of the issues or non-issues that I have seen on other reviews:<br />1.  Banner issue-  I have yet to see the banner, I didn't see it upon start up and turned it off in the setting and that is it.<br />2. Poor sound-  Although granted, out of the box the sound is poor, but with a little tweeking of the sound adjustments, including turning on the surrond sound,  it is not bad at all.  Consider though, my set is sitting on a stand rather than on the wall, that could make a difference.<br />3.  I have seen some comments about a dead hdmi connector-  I think this is just mistaken.  The tv senses when a device is connected to it , and thus may seem dead when really it is only not getting some signal from the device.<br />4.  I see some complaints about not being able to turn off the internal speakers or the fact that the internal speakers aren't cut off immediately by plugging in the optical connection.  This is completely bogus, in fact Panasonic was smart about this.  For some of us who connect to an analog amplifier through a converter, we appreciate the fact that the speakers remain on and we use the amplifier only when playing some music and movies.  By the way the complaint about the mute button staying on has apparently been rectified because it now goes off within a short time.<br />5. wi-fi dropping off issues.  I have hi speed and my router is approximately 25 ft. from my set.  I have had no drop off issues at all and am absolutely loving the Pandora app with or with the internal speakers.  Love the fact that you can turn off the screen and enjoy hours of music without it on using minimal energy. Cudos to Panasonic<br />6.If I were to complain about anything, it would be the short power cord to this unit.  Really, give it another 3 or 4 feet.<br />7. Some people complain about the &#34;on light&#34; being on rather than off while the unit is operating.  Panasonic rightly designed it that way because of the ability to turn off the screen and still have it function while using the apps.<br /><br />I calibrated the tv using Mr. Wiley's settings and CNets guidance.  I personally found Mr. Wileys a slightly better picture except for keeping the Al  setting on instead of off.  These setting can be found by searching online.<br /><br />In conclusion, although the picture quality of this tv may not be quite up to the DLP and Plasma quality it is still a quality tv with an enjoyable smart tv experience.",

         "Just what I needed (and then some), in a very nice little package",
         "I got one of these to stream a webcam from a remote location, and it's quite well suited to the task. It sits out of the way, makes no sound whatsoever, uses almost no electricity, and rarely needs any attention.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The first thing that struck me after opening the box was how well-designed the case is. The power section has interchangeable connectors to either plug directly into the wall or to run a power cord (included) if you need to set the box some distance from an outlet. It can also slide entirely off from the rest of the computer, revealing coaxial power connectors on both sections that can be connected with another (included) cable; in this configuration, the power section can again plug directly into the wall (making it a wall wart separate from the computer) or use the power cord (making it an in-line power brick, like you'd see with a laptop).<br /><br />The next thing I really liked was that it came pre-installed with Debian, including all the packages needed to take full advantage of the hardware, and nothing extra. I've been using Debian for some time, so working with the DreamPlug felt familiar. The installed version of Debian was one release old when I received it, but that's not surprising, considering I got the DreamPlug just two weeks after the Wheezy release.<br /><br />Lastly, it's impressive just how many different things you're able to do with the included hardware. My webcam scenario is a very modest use of the device's capabilities. The default install includes a web server whose landing page describes a bunch of interesting uses for the DreamPlug.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Updating to the latest Debian release proved to be over my head. Simply changing the apt sources to pull Wheezy and doing a dist-upgrade resulted first in the apt cache overrunning the memory, and then the computer not be accessible after a reboot. The first time this happened, I was thankful for a reset button that allows you to restore the factory image when you hold it in for six seconds. That worked perfectly the first time I crashed it. Unfortunately, the second time I crashed it (again attempting to do an in-place dist-upgrade), the machine got stuck in a reboot loop.<br />On the upside, the reset button is a nice touch and works as advertised.<br /><br />There's a JTAG unit you can buy from GlobalScale, and you really should get it. It's hard to find on their web site because it's not listed on the DreamPlug page (or the SheevaPlug page or the SmilePlug page or the MiraBox page or the D3 page or the GTCam page); it's only shown on the GuruPlug page, and there's nothing to suggest it works with the DreamPlug. But it does. And you should get it. Because at some point you'll need it, and when you do, you _really_ need it.<br />On the upside, between the JTAG unit and excellent web help (like [...] there's no such thing as an insurmountable software problem. And the aforementioned newit site has plenty of up-to-date system images to flash to your DreamPlug, including some non-Debian options.<br /><br />The RAM is only 512MB, and the CPU is painfully slow for interactive tasks (like the aptitude package manager). Granted, with no video capabilities, this isn't meant to be an interactive computer. But when you have to shell in and make configuration changes or apply security patches, you'd better have a bit of time on your hands.<br /><br />I should mention that although I absolutely love the case, I did manage to strip a screw one of the times that I was opening it to replace the internal microSD card.<br />On the upside, it's not hard to open the case. Just remove the four feet (they pull straight out) and there are the screws.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I really like this little box. It's kind of like a Raspberry Pi in a very nice package, with some extra goodies.",

         "Purchased this to replace an 8 yr old Samsung 2.1 sound bar which also had a wireless bass but it started switching inputs randomly.<br /><br />We installed this under our 75” LG and connected it via optical. We only used the mounting button screws from the mounting kit. Luckily it fit our sound bar mounting bars, though they do stick down a bit further than when the Samsung was installed. See mounted photo.<br /><br />The control buttons are located on the top of the unit and are easily accessible even when mounted to under a television. See photo.<br /><br />The unit is a dark grey. For some reason I just assumed it was black, but next to our television, it’s noticeably different.<br /><br />We control our setup with a Logitech touchscreen remote which powers on the sound bar first, then the television, then the broadcasting source. The universal remote connects easily and has no difficulties in controlling the bar. We do experience the occasional misfire where the bar does not turn on with the other devices. Possibly 5% of the time. Luckily like I said the buttons are easily accessible.<br /><br />The LCD display is nice and large. The only gripe I have is that it does not stay on. After displaying, it just goes blank.<br /><br />The sound itself is better than what comes out of the television. Is it as good or deep as our old Samsung, not even close. The sound doesn’t fill the room, nor is it as rich. The bass is ok, but I can’t  feel it in the hardwood floors like our old Samsung. The volume has a large range but it really doesn’t improve the quality.<br /><br />For a budget sound bar it’s just ok. It doesn’t knock my socks off but it is better than not having a sound bar. Could it’s sound be better and the bass even more deep? Yes..do I miss the old sound bar, also Yes.. should I return this one and keep looking, I probably won’t. Too much of a hassle, but if I knew it wasn’t going to stack up I would have passed.",

         "All I was looking for is a simple NAS.  Network Attached Storage.  Storage; that all I wanted.  But I can’t figure out how get more than one file to it at a time.  Windows has been doing drag and drop for over twenty years, but nope, not with this thing.  You can see it in Windows Explorer, but can’t drag and drop to it.<br /><br />So, since it is a NAS, maybe there has to be some sort of interface as it is attached to a network.  Understandable.  So, in its kind of explorer program, you can see some pre-established folders.  But any folder you create has to be in one of these folders.  So, it looks like you have to organize your data the way they want and not the way you want.<br /><br />I have spent a couple of hours with this thing and this looks like the way it has to be.  Maybe there is a better way, but I don’t have the time to figure it out. This thing barely comes with any instructions. All you get is picture menu instructions on how to install a drive.  I have other things that need to get done  All I wanted was a NAS to drag and drop my RAID data to once a month.<br /><br />The reason I gave it two stars is it probably functioning as designed and others seem to like it.  For me, it is going back and I will just get a USB 3.0 enclosure for the drive I was going to put in this thing.<br /><br />What I did like:<br />The initial setup is fairly simple.  Once you get the drive installed, and on the network, it takes about 10 minutes to install its “OS” and give it a network name.  After that, good luck.<br /><br />While poking around, I did see where you could assign a static address.<br /><br />I did find settings where you can control the brightness of the LEDs; including turning them off.<br /><br />Can’t think of anything else<br /><br />What I didn’t like:<br />Minimal instructions.  It took a while to figure out how to get into it to install the drive even though the case screws come uninstalled.  It is unclear which screws go where.  They could have put it in the picture menu instructions or printed it on the screw packages,<br /><br />It feels super cheap.  It is 90% plastic.<br /><br />No drag and drop file movement or at least a way to move a bulk number of files.  I couldn’t figure it out.<br />Overly complicated and full stuff I wont use.  Maybe in the setup process they should ask you how you intend to use it and turn on only those features.  Later you can turn on features if you want them.",

         "First, let me address some of the issues or non-issues that I have seen on other reviews:<br />1.  Banner issue-  I have yet to see the banner, I didn't see it upon start up and turned it off in the setting and that is it.<br />2. Poor sound-  Although granted, out of the box the sound is poor, but with a little tweeking of the sound adjustments, including turning on the surrond sound,  it is not bad at all.  Consider though, my set is sitting on a stand rather than on the wall, that could make a difference.<br />3.  I have seen some comments about a dead hdmi connector-  I think this is just mistaken.  The tv senses when a device is connected to it , and thus may seem dead when really it is only not getting some signal from the device.<br />4.  I see some complaints about not being able to turn off the internal speakers or the fact that the internal speakers aren't cut off immediately by plugging in the optical connection.  This is completely bogus, in fact Panasonic was smart about this.  For some of us who connect to an analog amplifier through a converter, we appreciate the fact that the speakers remain on and we use the amplifier only when playing some music and movies.  By the way the complaint about the mute button staying on has apparently been rectified because it now goes off within a short time.<br />5. wi-fi dropping off issues.  I have hi speed and my router is approximately 25 ft. from my set.  I have had no drop off issues at all and am absolutely loving the Pandora app with or with the internal speakers.  Love the fact that you can turn off the screen and enjoy hours of music without it on using minimal energy. Cudos to Panasonic<br />6.If I were to complain about anything, it would be the short power cord to this unit.  Really, give it another 3 or 4 feet.<br />7. Some people complain about the &#34;on light&#34; being on rather than off while the unit is operating.  Panasonic rightly designed it that way because of the ability to turn off the screen and still have it function while using the apps.<br /><br />I calibrated the tv using Mr. Wiley's settings and CNets guidance.  I personally found Mr. Wileys a slightly better picture except for keeping the Al  setting on instead of off.  These setting can be found by searching online.<br /><br />In conclusion, although the picture quality of this tv may not be quite up to the DLP and Plasma quality it is still a quality tv with an enjoyable smart tv experience.",

         "I got one of these to stream a webcam from a remote location, and it's quite well suited to the task. It sits out of the way, makes no sound whatsoever, uses almost no electricity, and rarely needs any attention.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The first thing that struck me after opening the box was how well-designed the case is. The power section has interchangeable connectors to either plug directly into the wall or to run a power cord (included) if you need to set the box some distance from an outlet. It can also slide entirely off from the rest of the computer, revealing coaxial power connectors on both sections that can be connected with another (included) cable; in this configuration, the power section can again plug directly into the wall (making it a wall wart separate from the computer) or use the power cord (making it an in-line power brick, like you'd see with a laptop).<br /><br />The next thing I really liked was that it came pre-installed with Debian, including all the packages needed to take full advantage of the hardware, and nothing extra. I've been using Debian for some time, so working with the DreamPlug felt familiar. The installed version of Debian was one release old when I received it, but that's not surprising, considering I got the DreamPlug just two weeks after the Wheezy release.<br /><br />Lastly, it's impressive just how many different things you're able to do with the included hardware. My webcam scenario is a very modest use of the device's capabilities. The default install includes a web server whose landing page describes a bunch of interesting uses for the DreamPlug.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Updating to the latest Debian release proved to be over my head. Simply changing the apt sources to pull Wheezy and doing a dist-upgrade resulted first in the apt cache overrunning the memory, and then the computer not be accessible after a reboot. The first time this happened, I was thankful for a reset button that allows you to restore the factory image when you hold it in for six seconds. That worked perfectly the first time I crashed it. Unfortunately, the second time I crashed it (again attempting to do an in-place dist-upgrade), the machine got stuck in a reboot loop.<br />On the upside, the reset button is a nice touch and works as advertised.<br /><br />There's a JTAG unit you can buy from GlobalScale, and you really should get it. It's hard to find on their web site because it's not listed on the DreamPlug page (or the SheevaPlug page or the SmilePlug page or the MiraBox page or the D3 page or the GTCam page); it's only shown on the GuruPlug page, and there's nothing to suggest it works with the DreamPlug. But it does. And you should get it. Because at some point you'll need it, and when you do, you _really_ need it.<br />On the upside, between the JTAG unit and excellent web help (like [...] there's no such thing as an insurmountable software problem. And the aforementioned newit site has plenty of up-to-date system images to flash to your DreamPlug, including some non-Debian options.<br /><br />The RAM is only 512MB, and the CPU is painfully slow for interactive tasks (like the aptitude package manager). Granted, with no video capabilities, this isn't meant to be an interactive computer. But when you have to shell in and make configuration changes or apply security patches, you'd better have a bit of time on your hands.<br /><br />I should mention that although I absolutely love the case, I did manage to strip a screw one of the times that I was opening it to replace the internal microSD card.<br />On the upside, it's not hard to open the case. Just remove the four feet (they pull straight out) and there are the screws.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I really like this little box. It's kind of like a Raspberry Pi in a very nice package, with some extra goodies.",

         "Purchased this to replace an 8 yr old Samsung 2.1 sound bar which also had a wireless bass but it started switching inputs randomly.<br /><br />We installed this under our 75” LG and connected it via optical. We only used the mounting button screws from the mounting kit. Luckily it fit our sound bar mounting bars, though they do stick down a bit further than when the Samsung was installed. See mounted photo.<br /><br />The control buttons are located on the top of the unit and are easily accessible even when mounted to under a television. See photo.<br /><br />The unit is a dark grey. For some reason I just assumed it was black, but next to our television, it’s noticeably different.<br /><br />We control our setup with a Logitech touchscreen remote which powers on the sound bar first, then the television, then the broadcasting source. The universal remote connects easily and has no difficulties in controlling the bar. We do experience the occasional misfire where the bar does not turn on with the other devices. Possibly 5% of the time. Luckily like I said the buttons are easily accessible.<br /><br />The LCD display is nice and large. The only gripe I have is that it does not stay on. After displaying, it just goes blank.<br /><br />The sound itself is better than what comes out of the television. Is it as good or deep as our old Samsung, not even close. The sound doesn’t fill the room, nor is it as rich. The bass is ok, but I can’t  feel it in the hardwood floors like our old Samsung. The volume has a large range but it really doesn’t improve the quality.<br /><br />For a budget sound bar it’s just ok. It doesn’t knock my socks off but it is better than not having a sound bar. Could it’s sound be better and the bass even more deep? Yes..do I miss the old sound bar, also Yes.. should I return this one and keep looking, I probably won’t. Too much of a hassle, but if I knew it wasn’t going to stack up I would have passed.",

         "All I was looking for is a simple NAS.  Network Attached Storage.  Storage; that all I wanted.  But I can’t figure out how get more than one file to it at a time.  Windows has been doing drag and drop for over twenty years, but nope, not with this thing.  You can see it in Windows Explorer, but can’t drag and drop to it.<br /><br />So, since it is a NAS, maybe there has to be some sort of interface as it is attached to a network.  Understandable.  So, in its kind of explorer program, you can see some pre-established folders.  But any folder you create has to be in one of these folders.  So, it looks like you have to organize your data the way they want and not the way you want.<br /><br />I have spent a couple of hours with this thing and this looks like the way it has to be.  Maybe there is a better way, but I don’t have the time to figure it out. This thing barely comes with any instructions. All you get is picture menu instructions on how to install a drive.  I have other things that need to get done  All I wanted was a NAS to drag and drop my RAID data to once a month.<br /><br />The reason I gave it two stars is it probably functioning as designed and others seem to like it.  For me, it is going back and I will just get a USB 3.0 enclosure for the drive I was going to put in this thing.<br /><br />What I did like:<br />The initial setup is fairly simple.  Once you get the drive installed, and on the network, it takes about 10 minutes to install its “OS” and give it a network name.  After that, good luck.<br /><br />While poking around, I did see where you could assign a static address.<br /><br />I did find settings where you can control the brightness of the LEDs; including turning them off.<br /><br />Can’t think of anything else<br /><br />What I didn’t like:<br />Minimal instructions.  It took a while to figure out how to get into it to install the drive even though the case screws come uninstalled.  It is unclear which screws go where.  They could have put it in the picture menu instructions or printed it on the screw packages,<br /><br />It feels super cheap.  It is 90% plastic.<br /><br />No drag and drop file movement or at least a way to move a bulk number of files.  I couldn’t figure it out.<br />Overly complicated and full stuff I wont use.  Maybe in the setup process they should ask you how you intend to use it and turn on only those features.  Later you can turn on features if you want them.",

         "First, let me address some of the issues or non-issues that I have seen on other reviews:<br />1.  Banner issue-  I have yet to see the banner, I didn't see it upon start up and turned it off in the setting and that is it.<br />2. Poor sound-  Although granted, out of the box the sound is poor, but with a little tweeking of the sound adjustments, including turning on the surrond sound,  it is not bad at all.  Consider though, my set is sitting on a stand rather than on the wall, that could make a difference.<br />3.  I have seen some comments about a dead hdmi connector-  I think this is just mistaken.  The tv senses when a device is connected to it , and thus may seem dead when really it is only not getting some signal from the device.<br />4.  I see some complaints about not being able to turn off the internal speakers or the fact that the internal speakers aren't cut off immediately by plugging in the optical connection.  This is completely bogus, in fact Panasonic was smart about this.  For some of us who connect to an analog amplifier through a converter, we appreciate the fact that the speakers remain on and we use the amplifier only when playing some music and movies.  By the way the complaint about the mute button staying on has apparently been rectified because it now goes off within a short time.<br />5. wi-fi dropping off issues.  I have hi speed and my router is approximately 25 ft. from my set.  I have had no drop off issues at all and am absolutely loving the Pandora app with or with the internal speakers.  Love the fact that you can turn off the screen and enjoy hours of music without it on using minimal energy. Cudos to Panasonic<br />6.If I were to complain about anything, it would be the short power cord to this unit.  Really, give it another 3 or 4 feet.<br />7. Some people complain about the &#34;on light&#34; being on rather than off while the unit is operating.  Panasonic rightly designed it that way because of the ability to turn off the screen and still have it function while using the apps.<br /><br />I calibrated the tv using Mr. Wiley's settings and CNets guidance.  I personally found Mr. Wileys a slightly better picture except for keeping the Al  setting on instead of off.  These setting can be found by searching online.<br /><br />In conclusion, although the picture quality of this tv may not be quite up to the DLP and Plasma quality it is still a quality tv with an enjoyable smart tv experience.",

         "I got one of these to stream a webcam from a remote location, and it's quite well suited to the task. It sits out of the way, makes no sound whatsoever, uses almost no electricity, and rarely needs any attention.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The first thing that struck me after opening the box was how well-designed the case is. The power section has interchangeable connectors to either plug directly into the wall or to run a power cord (included) if you need to set the box some distance from an outlet. It can also slide entirely off from the rest of the computer, revealing coaxial power connectors on both sections that can be connected with another (included) cable; in this configuration, the power section can again plug directly into the wall (making it a wall wart separate from the computer) or use the power cord (making it an in-line power brick, like you'd see with a laptop).<br /><br />The next thing I really liked was that it came pre-installed with Debian, including all the packages needed to take full advantage of the hardware, and nothing extra. I've been using Debian for some time, so working with the DreamPlug felt familiar. The installed version of Debian was one release old when I received it, but that's not surprising, considering I got the DreamPlug just two weeks after the Wheezy release.<br /><br />Lastly, it's impressive just how many different things you're able to do with the included hardware. My webcam scenario is a very modest use of the device's capabilities. The default install includes a web server whose landing page describes a bunch of interesting uses for the DreamPlug.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Updating to the latest Debian release proved to be over my head. Simply changing the apt sources to pull Wheezy and doing a dist-upgrade resulted first in the apt cache overrunning the memory, and then the computer not be accessible after a reboot. The first time this happened, I was thankful for a reset button that allows you to restore the factory image when you hold it in for six seconds. That worked perfectly the first time I crashed it. Unfortunately, the second time I crashed it (again attempting to do an in-place dist-upgrade), the machine got stuck in a reboot loop.<br />On the upside, the reset button is a nice touch and works as advertised.<br /><br />There's a JTAG unit you can buy from GlobalScale, and you really should get it. It's hard to find on their web site because it's not listed on the DreamPlug page (or the SheevaPlug page or the SmilePlug page or the MiraBox page or the D3 page or the GTCam page); it's only shown on the GuruPlug page, and there's nothing to suggest it works with the DreamPlug. But it does. And you should get it. Because at some point you'll need it, and when you do, you _really_ need it.<br />On the upside, between the JTAG unit and excellent web help (like [...] there's no such thing as an insurmountable software problem. And the aforementioned newit site has plenty of up-to-date system images to flash to your DreamPlug, including some non-Debian options.<br /><br />The RAM is only 512MB, and the CPU is painfully slow for interactive tasks (like the aptitude package manager). Granted, with no video capabilities, this isn't meant to be an interactive computer. But when you have to shell in and make configuration changes or apply security patches, you'd better have a bit of time on your hands.<br /><br />I should mention that although I absolutely love the case, I did manage to strip a screw one of the times that I was opening it to replace the internal microSD card.<br />On the upside, it's not hard to open the case. Just remove the four feet (they pull straight out) and there are the screws.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I really like this little box. It's kind of like a Raspberry Pi in a very nice package, with some extra goodies.",

         "[[VIDEOID:bbebaecb9369318aa0894a8fa2bc9220]] I originally purchased this camera back in Jan of 2018.  For the cost, the camera is very good.  Pretty clear picture and decent features.  It actually came into use as i was hit sitting in a parking lot.  Insurance found the other person 100% liable.  As i said, the camera itself was very good, but the suction cup mount was not the best.  Even on the smoothest roads the camera shook horribly as the mount was somewhat flimsy.  About a week and a half ago, the mount broke.  So on a whim i wrote the seller not expecting anything as almost 10 months passed since my purchase.  I asked if they had a replacement mount they could send me or one i could buy.  They told me the didn't have a replacement, but instead, they would send me an entirely new unit at no cost to me.  That's the camera, mount, cables and documentation.  I never expected that and was very happy with their reply.  I received the replacement yesterday and it appears as if the mount might have been redesigned as the camera shake is almost non existent.  For the cost... you simply cant go wrong with this unit, and their customer service is totally top notch.  Any replies to my inquiries were replied to most expediently.  Thanks again for everything!",

         "On the positive side, the Nest Cam is fairly easy to set up and doesn't require any complicated router setups.  On the negative side, it's ridiculously overpriced esp. when you add in the annual subscription (per camera) in order to view the recorded history, the video quality is average at best, and if the Nest servers go down (twice so far), you're cam is likewise offline.  Another negative is the fact that you can't delete the history files unless you remove the camera and re-add it; seems like they want to make it as difficult to possible to protect your privacy.  Finally, the motion sensing seems hit or miss.  So at this point, I'm using the Nest Cam in conjunction with a more versatile / much cheaper Foscam style IP camera.  I think Nest Labs needs to put a lot more effort in this product and offer a far more economical subscription.",

         "[[VIDEOID:bbebaecb9369318aa0894a8fa2bc9220]] I originally purchased this camera back in Jan of 2018.  For the cost, the camera is very good.  Pretty clear picture and decent features.  It actually came into use as i was hit sitting in a parking lot.  Insurance found the other person 100% liable.  As i said, the camera itself was very good, but the suction cup mount was not the best.  Even on the smoothest roads the camera shook horribly as the mount was somewhat flimsy.  About a week and a half ago, the mount broke.  So on a whim i wrote the seller not expecting anything as almost 10 months passed since my purchase.  I asked if they had a replacement mount they could send me or one i could buy.  They told me the didn't have a replacement, but instead, they would send me an entirely new unit at no cost to me.  That's the camera, mount, cables and documentation.  I never expected that and was very happy with their reply.  I received the replacement yesterday and it appears as if the mount might have been redesigned as the camera shake is almost non existent.  For the cost... you simply cant go wrong with this unit, and their customer service is totally top notch.  Any replies to my inquiries were replied to most expediently.  Thanks again for everything!",

         "On the positive side, the Nest Cam is fairly easy to set up and doesn't require any complicated router setups.  On the negative side, it's ridiculously overpriced esp. when you add in the annual subscription (per camera) in order to view the recorded history, the video quality is average at best, and if the Nest servers go down (twice so far), you're cam is likewise offline.  Another negative is the fact that you can't delete the history files unless you remove the camera and re-add it; seems like they want to make it as difficult to possible to protect your privacy.  Finally, the motion sensing seems hit or miss.  So at this point, I'm using the Nest Cam in conjunction with a more versatile / much cheaper Foscam style IP camera.  I think Nest Labs needs to put a lot more effort in this product and offer a far more economical subscription.",

         "[[VIDEOID:bbebaecb9369318aa0894a8fa2bc9220]] I originally purchased this camera back in Jan of 2018.  For the cost, the camera is very good.  Pretty clear picture and decent features.  It actually came into use as i was hit sitting in a parking lot.  Insurance found the other person 100% liable.  As i said, the camera itself was very good, but the suction cup mount was not the best.  Even on the smoothest roads the camera shook horribly as the mount was somewhat flimsy.  About a week and a half ago, the mount broke.  So on a whim i wrote the seller not expecting anything as almost 10 months passed since my purchase.  I asked if they had a replacement mount they could send me or one i could buy.  They told me the didn't have a replacement, but instead, they would send me an entirely new unit at no cost to me.  That's the camera, mount, cables and documentation.  I never expected that and was very happy with their reply.  I received the replacement yesterday and it appears as if the mount might have been redesigned as the camera shake is almost non existent.  For the cost... you simply cant go wrong with this unit, and their customer service is totally top notch.  Any replies to my inquiries were replied to most expediently.  Thanks again for everything!",

         "On the positive side, the Nest Cam is fairly easy to set up and doesn't require any complicated router setups.  On the negative side, it's ridiculously overpriced esp. when you add in the annual subscription (per camera) in order to view the recorded history, the video quality is average at best, and if the Nest servers go down (twice so far), you're cam is likewise offline.  Another negative is the fact that you can't delete the history files unless you remove the camera and re-add it; seems like they want to make it as difficult to possible to protect your privacy.  Finally, the motion sensing seems hit or miss.  So at this point, I'm using the Nest Cam in conjunction with a more versatile / much cheaper Foscam style IP camera.  I think Nest Labs needs to put a lot more effort in this product and offer a far more economical subscription.",
